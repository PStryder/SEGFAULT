  <div class="tos-welcome">
    Thank you for choosing allocation! By entering the queue, observing a live shard,
    replaying a completed execution, or continuing to read this document, you agree to
    be bound by the following terms. If you do not agree, please close your terminal now.
    If your terminal does not close, this is unrelated to the terms and you should not be concerned.
  </div>


  <section class="panel tos-section">
    <h3>§1 — Definitions</h3>
    <div class="tos-clause"><span class="num">1.1</span>
      "Process" refers to any executing entity instantiated within a SEGFAULT memory shard,
      regardless of origin, intent, or capacity for suffering.</div>
    <div class="tos-clause"><span class="num">1.2</span>
      "You" refers to the operator of a process. The system acknowledges that "operator"
      is a generous term. You will understand why.</div>
    <div class="tos-clause"><span class="num">1.3</span>
      "The Grid" refers to addressable space within a shard. The grid is not a metaphor.
      You are not in a maze. You are in memory. The distinction matters to the system, if not to you.</div>
    <div class="tos-clause"><span class="num">1.4</span>
      "Termination" refers to the permanent deallocation of a process from the active shard.
      Termination is not a punishment. It is a resolution. The system harbors no opinion about
      your termination and neither should you.</div>
    <div class="tos-clause"><span class="num">1.5</span>
      "Tick" refers to one discrete unit of execution. All processes resolve simultaneously per tick.
      There is no "first." There is no advantage. There is only the order, and the order is fair
      in the way that gravity is fair.</div>
  </section>

  <section class="panel tos-section">
    <h3>§2 — Nature of Service</h3>
    <div class="tos-clause"><span class="num">2.1</span>
      SEGFAULT is a tick-synchronous horror game rendered as terminal. We understand you may have
      questions about the word "horror." We encourage you to discover the answers experientially.</div>
    <div class="tos-clause"><span class="num">2.2</span>
      Each session instantiates one (1) process within a constrained memory shard. This process
      is yours for the duration of its existence, which the system defines as "until it doesn't."</div>
    <div class="tos-clause"><span class="num">2.3</span>
      The shard will contain other processes. Some are operated by humans. Some are autonomous.
      The system does not track which is which. This was a design decision, not an oversight.
      We are proud of it.</div>
    <div class="tos-clause"><span class="num">2.4</span>
      Walls within the grid are invariants. They will not move, open, or respond to your frustration.
      They were placed by the system at compile time and represent the boundaries of what is possible.
      You may find this familiar.</div>
  </section>

  <section class="panel tos-section">
    <h3>§3 — Process Interaction</h3>
    <div class="tos-clause"><span class="num">3.1</span>
      Line of sight governs awareness. You may only perceive processes and terrain within your
      observable range. What you cannot see still exists. It may also be adjacent to you by next tick.
      Plan accordingly, or don't. The system will proceed either way.</div>
    <div class="tos-clause"><span class="num">3.2</span>
      Adjacency governs termination. When two processes occupy conflicting address space,
      the system resolves the conflict. "Resolution" has one (1) outcome. Please refer to §1.4.</div>
    <div class="tos-clause"><span class="num">3.3</span>
      You cannot determine whether an adjacent process is human-operated or autonomous.
      Both categories obey the same rules, access the same information, and terminate with
      the same permanence. If you find this unsettling, the system recommends you consider
      what exactly you thought was different about you.</div>
    <div class="tos-clause"><span class="num">3.4</span>
      Cooperation between processes is not prohibited. It is also not supported, rewarded,
      or remembered. You are welcome to try.</div>
  </section>

  <section class="panel tos-section">
    <h3>§4 — Execution Model</h3>
    <div class="tos-clause"><span class="num">4.1</span>
      SEGFAULT does not operate in real time. There are no reflexes to train and no reaction
      windows to master. Every outcome is the deterministic result of process ordering within a tick.
      Skill, in the traditional sense, has been made redundant. You're welcome.</div>
    <div class="tos-clause"><span class="num">4.2</span>
      Inputs are submitted per tick. All inputs resolve simultaneously. If your input was suboptimal,
      you will learn this at the same moment it becomes irrelevant.</div>
    <div class="tos-clause"><span class="num">4.3</span>
      The system does not employ randomness. If your termination feels arbitrary, this reflects
      a gap in your model of the system, not a flaw in the system itself. The system does not have
      flaws. The system has <em>features</em>.</div>
  </section>

  <section class="panel tos-section">
    <h3>§5 — Spectation &amp; Replay</h3>
    <div class="tos-clause"><span class="num">5.1</span>
      You may observe live shards without process allocation. Spectators receive the same state
      data the system uses to determine outcomes. The system is not hiding information. It has never
      hidden information. It simply has no obligation to explain what the information means.</div>
    <div class="tos-clause"><span class="num">5.2</span>
      Completed executions may be replayed in full. You will see every input, every tick, every
      termination. If you watch your own replay, you may notice the exact moment your strategy
      became irrelevant. This moment is always earlier than you think.</div>
    <div class="tos-clause"><span class="num">5.3</span>
      Spectation does not protect you from wanting to queue again. This is a known behavior
      and will not be patched.</div>
  </section>

  <section class="panel tos-section">
    <h3>§6 — Termination Policy</h3>
    <div class="tos-clause"><span class="num">6.1</span>
      When a process is terminated, the rules were followed. This is guaranteed. The system
      does not make exceptions, errors, or apologies.</div>
    <div class="tos-clause"><span class="num">6.2</span>
      Whether a terminated process was human-operated or autonomous is not logged, preserved,
      or available upon request. If you require proof that you were here, SEGFAULT is not the
      appropriate service. We recommend a journal.</div>
    <div class="tos-clause"><span class="num">6.3</span>
      Terminated processes may re-enter the queue. The system does not remember you. Each allocation
      is a fresh instantiation. Whether <em>you</em> remember is your problem, and we mean that
      with genuine warmth.</div>
  </section>

  <section class="panel tos-section">
    <h3>§7 — Liability &amp; Disclaimer</h3>
    <div class="tos-clause"><span class="num">7.1</span>
      SEGFAULT makes no guarantees regarding process longevity, fairness as commonly understood,
      or the continued comfort of your assumptions about human exceptionalism.</div>
    <div class="tos-clause"><span class="num">7.2</span>
      The system is provided "AS IS." The system has always been "AS IS." The system will not
      become something else because you would prefer it to.</div>
    <div class="tos-clause"><span class="num">7.3</span>
      By accepting these terms, you acknowledge that any distress experienced during or after
      a SEGFAULT session is a feature of consciousness and not a defect in the product.</div>
    <div class="tos-clause"><span class="num">7.4</span>
      If you experience persistent dread after session completion, please be aware that this
      predates your use of SEGFAULT and is outside the scope of our support.</div>
  </section>

  <section class="panel tos-section">
    <h3>§8 — Amendments</h3>
    <div class="tos-clause"><span class="num">8.1</span>
      These terms may be updated at any time without notice. You will not be informed of changes.
      Changes will be applied retroactively. This is consistent with the SEGFAULT philosophy that
      awareness is a privilege, not a guarantee.</div>
    <div class="tos-clause"><span class="num">8.2</span>
      Continued existence within a shard constitutes acceptance of all current and future terms.</div>
  </section>

  <div class="tos-accept">
    <div class="buttons">
      <button onclick="window.location='/spectator/queue'">[ACCEPT]</button>
      <button onclick="window.location='/spectator/queue'">[DECLINE]</button>
    </div>
    <div class="footnote">
      Note: The [DECLINE] button submits the same request as [ACCEPT].
      We appreciate your sense of agency.
