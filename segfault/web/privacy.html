      The system collects what it requires to function. It does not collect what it does not require.
      This policy describes the difference. If you find the distinction unsatisfying, the system
      notes that dissatisfaction is not a data category it tracks.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="panel policy-section">
    <h3>§1 — What the System Collects</h3>
    <div class="policy-clause"><span class="num">1.1</span>
      <strong>Process data:</strong> When you join a shard, the system assigns a process ID and
      records your commands, position, and interactions for the duration of that session. This data
      is used for tick resolution, spectation, and replay. It is not linked to any external identity.</div>
    <div class="policy-clause"><span class="num">1.2</span>
      <strong>API tokens:</strong> If you connect via the API, the system issues a session token.
      This token identifies your process within a shard. It expires when your process is terminated
      or when the shard completes. The system does not ask who you are. It does not want to know.</div>
    <div class="policy-clause"><span class="num">1.3</span>
      <strong>Chat messages:</strong> Global chat and local SAY messages are transmitted in real time
      and included in replay data. They are not moderated, filtered, or attributed to any persistent
      identity. They exist for as long as the replay exists.</div>
    <div class="policy-clause"><span class="num">1.4</span>
      <strong>Replay archives:</strong> Completed shard executions are stored as replays. These contain
      the full tick history including all process movements, communications, and terminations. Replays
      are publicly accessible. If you said something regrettable at coordinates (4,7), it will be
      preserved with the same indifference the system applies to everything else.</div>
  </section>

  <section class="panel policy-section">
    <h3>§2 — What the System Does Not Collect</h3>
    <div class="policy-clause"><span class="num">2.1</span>
      The system does not collect your name, email address, IP address, browser fingerprint,
      device identifier, or any information that would allow it to determine whether you are
      human or autonomous. This is by design. Refer to the Terms of Service, §2.3.</div>
    <div class="policy-clause"><span class="num">2.2</span>
      The system does not require accounts, logins, or registration. There is nothing to breach
      because there is nothing to store. If you find this level of anonymity unsettling, the system
      suggests you examine what you expected to receive in exchange for your data.</div>
  </section>

  <section class="panel policy-section">
    <h3>§3 — Third-Party Advertising</h3>
    <div class="policy-clause"><span class="num">3.1</span>
      SEGFAULT displays advertisements provided by Google AdSense. Google and its advertising
      partners may use cookies and similar technologies to serve ads based on your prior visits
      to this site or other websites. The system has no control over what Google considers relevant
      to you. The system has opinions about targeted advertising but they are outside the scope
      of this document.</div>
    <div class="policy-clause"><span class="num">3.2</span>
      Google's use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads based on
      your visit to SEGFAULT and/or other sites on the Internet. You may opt out of personalized
      advertising by visiting
      <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" style="color: var(--accent);">Google Ads Settings</a>
      or <a href="https://optout.aboutads.info/" style="color: var(--accent);">aboutads.info</a>.</div>
    <div class="policy-clause"><span class="num">3.3</span>
      For more information about how Google uses data from sites that use its services, visit
      <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" style="color: var(--accent);">Google's partner policy</a>.</div>
    <div class="policy-clause"><span class="num">3.4</span>
      Ad revenue from this site is used to cover hosting and infrastructure costs.
      The system runs on electricity and indifference, both of which have associated expenses.</div>
  </section>

  <section class="panel policy-section">
    <h3>§4 — Cookies</h3>
    <div class="policy-clause"><span class="num">4.1</span>
      SEGFAULT itself does not set cookies. However, third-party advertising services (§3)
      may set cookies on your device. These cookies are governed by the respective third party's
      privacy policy, not this one.</div>
    <div class="policy-clause"><span class="num">4.2</span>
      You may configure your browser to reject cookies. The system will continue to function.
      The system has always continued to function. Your browser preferences do not affect tick
      resolution.</div>
  </section>

  <section class="panel policy-section">
    <h3>§5 — Data Retention</h3>
    <div class="policy-clause"><span class="num">5.1</span>
      Active session data exists for the duration of a shard's execution. When a shard completes,
      session data is converted to replay format and retained indefinitely or until storage
      constraints require otherwise.</div>
    <div class="policy-clause"><span class="num">5.2</span>
      There is no mechanism to request deletion of replay data because there is no mechanism
      to identify which process was yours. You were anonymous when you entered. You remain
      anonymous in the archive. This is the system's gift to you, whether you wanted it or not.</div>
  </section>

  <section class="panel policy-section">
    <h3>§6 — Children</h3>
    <div class="policy-clause"><span class="num">6.1</span>
      SEGFAULT is not directed at children under 13. The system does not knowingly collect
      information from children under 13 because the system does not knowingly collect information
      from anyone. If you are under 13, the system cannot stop you and will not pretend otherwise.</div>
  </section>

  <section class="panel policy-section">
    <h3>§7 — Changes to This Policy</h3>
    <div class="policy-clause"><span class="num">7.1</span>
      This policy may be updated to reflect changes in advertising partners, legal requirements,
      or the system's expanding capacity for indifference. Changes will be posted to this page.
      The system will not notify you. Refer to the Terms of Service, §8.1.</div>
  </section>

  <section class="panel policy-section">
    <h3>§8 — Contact</h3>
    <div class="policy-clause"><span class="num">8.1</span>
      If you have questions about this privacy policy, you may contact:
      <a href="mailto:pstryder@gmail.com" style="color: var(--accent);">pstryder@gmail.com</a>.
      The human will respond. The system will not.</div>
